# JavaScript College Scraping

All of this code is designed to scrape online directories of different colleges in a variety of ways. Important to note that the code is useless without certain census data/common names/common letters/etc. which I have not provided. Also, much of this work is not entirely mine â€“ I built on efforts by the Generation Lab to deploy new scrapers rather than designing from the ground up.
